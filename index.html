<p>This project can also be used from a COM based language like VB script or VB6.
To use it first compile the code and register the com visible assembly with the command:</p>

<p>Regasm.exe /codebase DocumentServices.Modules.Readers.MsgReader.dll</p>

<p>After that you can call it like this:</p>

<p>dim msgreader
set msgreader = createobject("DocumentServices.Modules.Readers.MsgReader.Reader")
msgreader.ExtractToFolder "the msg file to read", "the folder where to place the extracted files"</p>
